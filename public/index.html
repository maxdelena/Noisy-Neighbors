    Lyrics
    They've been sayin', "You're sophisticated"
    They're complainin', overeducated
    You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
    Say it after me
    Say it after me
    They will blame us, crucify and shame us
    We can't help it if we are a problem
    We are tryin' hard to get your attention
    I'm climbin' up your wall
    Climbin' up your wall
    Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
    I know you think of me when you think of her
    But then it don't make sense when you're tryin' hard
    To do the right thing but without recompense
    And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
    And now you don't know how you could ever complain
    Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
    But then you want me to do it the same as you
  </p>
