# AJAX Weather Lab

- This lab is not a deliverable, but completion is **strongly recommended** as your project for Unit One involves using an API; this lab is really good practice

- Create an app that uses a search form to show the weather in any city the user searches for
- Set this up as a seperate Project Repo, and push it to your personal Github; this is a wonderful first project to have in your portfolio

- Use the [Open Weather map](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get a forecast and display it on the page
- Start by coming up with your `User Stories`, then move on to `White-Boarding`, `Pseudocoding`, and `Wireframing`

- Create a `README.md` inside of your project's root directory you can use to describe what your app does

- Example headers in your project's README might include:

  - The Title of your App
  - Technologies/API used
  - Features
  - User Stories
  - Wireframes (you place hosted images in your README)
  - Stretch Goals/Future Goals

- If the user searches for another city, make sure the page is only showing ONE city's forecast at a time (i.e. make sure the previous results don't stay on the page)
- Add basic components to your app such as a `header`, `nav`, `footer` ...etc
- Add styling with `CSS`

## Bonus

Allow a drop-down menu for the user to choose how many days' worth of forecasts they want, then display that many days of weather predictions on the page.

## Super Bonus

Deploy your project to the web using Github Pages!
